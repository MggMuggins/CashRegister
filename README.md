Cash Register for ICP

The code quality on this thing is trash, but it does work, more or less. Let me know of any fatal bugs.

# Building
Install dub and a D2 compiler (dmd or gdc), then clone this repo and run ```dub``` in the project to build, fetch dependencies and run.

#Dependencies
We depend on [ConsoleD](https://github.com/robik/ConsoleD) for colors.
